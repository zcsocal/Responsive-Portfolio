                I’ve has been developing web content, writing feature articles, and directing non-profit marking projects for over 10 years.

                I’ve written for several newspapers, including the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, the Berea Citizen, and the Richmond Register. My work has been featured in Berea College Magazine, Equestrian Magazine, and various other publications. </p>

                <p>As communication director at the University of Kentucky Appalachian Center, I renovated the organizations print materials and online presence, which reestablished the connection between the center, the UK campus, and general public. He also implemented a successful photography contest, which was covered by the Associated Press due to it’s focus on discrediting negative stereotypes of Appalachia life.</p>

                <p>I relocated to Los Angeles in 2017 to explore new opportunities and enjoy the beautiful SoCal weather. Aside from work, I keep himself busy with a variety of volunteer projects, attending events like Burning Man, and going on long cross country trips.</p>
